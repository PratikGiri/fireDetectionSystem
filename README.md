### Instructions to run and test

1. Run the main function in the Main class which would open the UI with map.
2. Click 3 times on the map to mark the exit gates. (number of exit gates = 3, hardcoded).
3. After marking the 3 exit gates, Click on the map to select the source node(from where we need to find the shortest path)
4. To add fire, select on the green box on the bottom right corner(make sure it turns red), now any click would add the fire section.
